// Attention! HACK!
// In https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gradle-fury/gradle-fury/v1.1.4/gradle/android-support.gradle
// we have a hack to prevent builds from failing due to missing signing config. This is done by
// removing the signing task from the build if no keystore/pass is provided.
//
// At some point the signing task has been renamed from "validateReleaseSigning" to
// "validateSigningRelease", thus obviously breaking the build again.
//
// The following is just a copy of the relevant code from android-support.gradle adapted to the new
// name. This should be cleaned up in the future!
